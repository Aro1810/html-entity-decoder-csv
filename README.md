# CSV Decoder for Arabic Characters

This Python script is designed to decode Arabic characters that are represented as HTML entities (e.g., `&#x644;`) in CSV files. The script reads a CSV file, decodes the HTML entities, and saves the cleaned version to a new CSV file.


# run the following comand, Replace input_file.csv with the path to the file you want to decode, and output_file.csv with the desired path for the decoded file.

```
python decode_csv.py input_file.csv output_file.csv
```
